<h2>Introduction</h2>

Brain tumors are abnormal growths of cells in the brain that can cause various symptoms such as headaches, seizures, vision problems, personality changes, and more. Brain tumors can be classified into different types based on their location, origin, and behavior. Some of the most common types of brain tumors are glioma, meningioma, and pituitary.

Glioma is a type of brain tumor that arises from glial cells, which are the supportive cells of the nervous system. Gliomas can be further divided into astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, ependymoma, and glioblastoma, depending on the type of glial cell involved. Gliomas can vary in their grade, which indicates how fast they grow and how likely they are to spread.

Meningioma is a type of brain tumor that originates from the meninges, which are the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. Meningiomas are usually benign, meaning they do not invade nearby tissues or spread to other parts of the body. However, some meningiomas can be malignant, meaning they can grow rapidly and cause serious complications. Meningiomas can also be classified into different subtypes based on their histological features.

Pituitary is a type of brain tumor that develops from the pituitary gland, which is a small organ at the base of the brain that produces hormones that regulate various bodily functions. Pituitary tumors can be either functioning or non-functioning, depending on whether they secrete excess hormones or not. Pituitary tumors can cause various symptoms such as vision loss, headaches, fatigue, weight gain or loss, and hormonal imbalances.

Detecting and diagnosing brain tumors can be challenging, as they can have similar symptoms and appearances to other conditions. Moreover, brain tumors can be difficult to access and biopsy, as they are located inside the skull. Therefore, there is a need for a smart and reliable tool that can help doctors and patients identify and classify brain tumors based on non-invasive imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

That is why I have created BrainTumor Classifier, a smart app that can detect and classify brain tumors like glioma, meningioma, and pituitary based on MRI images. BrainTumor Classifier uses a deep learning model that can analyze MRI images and output the probability of each tumor type.

BrainTumor Classifier is easy to use and fast to run. All you need to do is upload an MRI image of the brain and click on the "Classify" button. BrainTumor Classifier will then process the image and display the results in a few seconds.

BrainTumor Classifier is not intended to replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. It is only meant to provide a preliminary screening and guidance for brain tumor detection. You should always consult your doctor before making any health-related decisions.
